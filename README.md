## Acknowledgements

This repository was created with guidance from [stegosaurusdormant's article on bare git repos](https://stegosaurusdormant.com/bare-git-repo/) and [newtolinux23's gist](https://gist.github.com/newtolinux23/234e4d0ee48274b836559e2afba41ac2). Their resources were invaluable in helping me set up a bare git repository for managing my NixOS configurations. This setup will also include [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) for user-level configuration management.
